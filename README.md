# MyReads Project

This is my implementation of MyReads app which part of the Front End Web Development Nanodegree. The starter code was provided by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). This app was developed in React.js.

In this project, the reader can see the books he is currently reading, has read and wants to read. Each book is placed on a shelf corresponding to the status of the book. The reader can also add books to his list, by clicking on the add button at the bottom right corner of the screen. he will there be able to search for books and add them to a shelf. Once he is done adding new books, he can return to his shelves by clicking the close button at the bottom right corner of the screen or by clicking on the back button.
